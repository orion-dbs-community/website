subtitle: "Sharing the load: Building an open research information collective"
toc: false
---

A growing, daily updated collection of publicly available datasets on Google BigQuery. Independent groups have come together to share the load of storage, preprocessing, and documentation, making open research information combinable and actionable at scale.

## Featured Collections

*Please also check the participating project websites for more information and for many more available datasets.*

### [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/)

A major DOI registration agency for publisher-provided open metadata. Used in many downstream sources.

[SUB Göttingen](collections/subugoe/) provides the [most recent monthly dump](collections/subugoe/#cr_instant) and [yearly snapshots](collections/subugoe/#cr_history). [Sesame Open Science](collections/sos/) gives access to the latest [public data dump](collections/sos/#crossref).

### [OpenAIRE](https://graph.openaire.eu/what-is-the-openaire-graph)

A free and open resource that interlinks hundreds of millions of metadata records from over 100k data sources.

[Sesame Open Science](collections/sos/) provides the full [OpenAIRE Graph Dataset](collections/sos/#openaire). [InSySPo Campinas](collections/insyspo/) offers time-specific versions.

### [OpenAlex](https://help.openalex.org/hc/en-us)

A free, open, and comprehensive bibliographic database and knowledge graph for scholarly research.

[SUB Göttingen](collections/subugoe/) provides the [Walden release](collections/subugoe/#openalex_walden) and [September 2025](collections/subugoe/#openalex) snapshots. [InSySPo Campinas](collections/insyspo/) offers [March](collections/insyspo/#publicdb_openalex_2025_03_rm) and [August 2025](collections/insyspo/#publicdb_openalex_2025_08_rm) snapshots.

## Get Started

1. **[Browse Collections](collections/)** -- Explore the available datasets from our contributing projects
2. **[Contribute](contributing.qmd)** -- Want to share your data? Check our contributing guide

## First steps

To query our datasets, you need a Google Cloud project. You can get started with the [BigQuery sandbox](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox), which requires no billing account and includes 1 TB of free queries per month. Replace `your-gcp-project` in the examples below with your own project ID.

This example joins data from two different collections -- article metadata from SUB Göttingen and a Crossref truth table from Sesame Open Science -- to check how many articles from the DEAL Wiley agreement (2019--23) have funder metadata in Crossref.

## SQL

```sql
-- Articles from the DEAL Wiley agreement (2019-23) with funder metadata in Crossref
SELECT cr_truth.has_funders, COUNT(DISTINCT jct_articles.doi) AS articles
FROM `subugoe-collaborative.openbib.jct_articles` AS jct_articles
LEFT JOIN sos-datasources.truthtables.crossref_truthtable_20250131 AS cr_truth
  ON lower(jct_articles.doi) = lower(cr_truth.doi)
WHERE jct_articles.esac_id = "wiley2019deal"
GROUP BY has_funders
```

## R

```r
library(bigrquery)
library(DBI)

my_con <- dbConnect(bigquery(), project = "your-gcp-project")

my_sql <- "
SELECT cr_truth.has_funders, COUNT(DISTINCT jct_articles.doi) AS articles
FROM `subugoe-collaborative.openbib.jct_articles` AS jct_articles
LEFT JOIN sos-datasources.truthtables.crossref_truthtable_20250131 AS cr_truth
  ON lower(jct_articles.doi) = lower(cr_truth.doi)
WHERE jct_articles.esac_id = 'wiley2019deal'
GROUP BY has_funders
"

my_df <- dbGetQuery(my_con, my_sql)
```

## Python

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client(project="your-gcp-project")

sql = """
SELECT cr_truth.has_funders, COUNT(DISTINCT jct_articles.doi) AS articles
FROM `subugoe-collaborative.openbib.jct_articles` AS jct_articles
LEFT JOIN sos-datasources.truthtables.crossref_truthtable_20250131 AS cr_truth
  ON lower(jct_articles.doi) = lower(cr_truth.doi)
WHERE jct_articles.esac_id = 'wiley2019deal'
GROUP BY has_funders
"""

result = client.query(sql).to_dataframe()
```
